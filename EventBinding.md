In Angular, event binding is a way to handle events raised by DOM elements (such as clicks, keypresses, mouse movements, etc.) 
within a component's template (HTML), and respond to those events by invoking methods defined in the component's TypeScript code.

Event binding allows you to execute functions in response to user actions or other events triggered within the application.
It establishes a communication link from the DOM element to the component class.

 
// Component TypeScript code
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <button (click)="onClick()">Click me!</button>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  onClick(): void {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
    // Additional logic can be added here
  }
}


click) is the event binding syntax, which binds the click event of the <button> element to the onClick() method in the component class.
When the button is clicked, the onClick() method in the component class is invoked, and the message "Button clicked!" is logged to the console.
