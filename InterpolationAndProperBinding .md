Interpolation and property binding are both ways to pass data from a component's TypeScript code to its template (HTML) in Angular,
but they differ in their syntax and use cases.
Interpolation ({{ }}):

    Interpolation is a one-way data binding technique where values from the component class are rendered directly in the HTML template.
    It's primarily used for rendering text content, such as strings, numbers, or expressions, within HTML elements.
    Interpolation is denoted by double curly braces ({{ }}) in the template.
    It automatically converts the data to a string before rendering it in the template.

    // Component TypeScript code
export class ExampleComponent {
  pageTitle: string = 'Welcome to Angular!';
}

<!-- Template -->
<h1>{{ pageTitle }}</h1>

Property Binding ([ ]):

    Property binding is a one-way data binding technique used to set properties of HTML elements dynamically based on values in the component class.
    It's used for binding HTML element properties like src, href, disabled, etc., to component properties.
    Property binding is denoted by square brackets ([ ]) in the template.
    It allows binding to both native HTML element properties and Angular directive properties.


// Component TypeScript code
export class ExampleComponent {
  imageUrl: string = 'assets/angular-logo.png';
}


<!-- Template -->
<img [src]="imageUrl" alt="Angular Logo">
